"Predicting Unknown Off-Grid Pixels in Images with a Neural Network" is a deep learning project focused on image inpainting. The objective is to train a neural network that can accurately fill in missing pixels in an image while preserving its overall structure and content.

The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to complete the missing parts of an image. The NN is trained on a large image dataset and is capable of handling various types of missing patterns. The resulting model can be utilized for a range of purposes, such as repairing damaged images, eliminating unwanted objects, or filling in gaps in an image.

The project includes the following stages:

1- Data Preparation
2- Building and Training the Neural Network
3- Model Evaluation
4- Applying the Model to Predict Missing Pixels in New Images.

The code is written in Python and powered by the TensorFlow library. The project features clear explanations and comments to make it accessible for those new to the field.
